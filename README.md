# nba-efficiency-predictor
A machine learning program written with Python that predicts the efficiency of an NBA player.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* [Python 2.7*](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - Installation Steps
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) - Installation Steps
* [numpy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) - Installation Steps
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html) - Installation Steps
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html) - Installation Steps
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - Installation Steps

### Project Setup
Using Git Bash or the Linux Terminal, navigate to the folder where you want the project located

```
git clone https://github.com/mmorth/nba-efficiency-predictor.git
```
Open a terminal window in the root folder of the project.

Edit the "Predict an input player" section at the bottom to predict a specific player.

To execute the program, run the following command
```
python -W ignore nba_efficiency_predictor.py
```
The program should execute and give you an output of the model accuracy and a result for your input player.
